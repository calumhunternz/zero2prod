Extractors
Extractors intercept incoming requests to handlers and and extract data
from them to perform various tasks. If all extractors complete without
an error only then in the handler ran
e.g. web::form<T> is an extractor that takes the form data and converts
it into the concrete type T for use in the handler so there is no need
to manually process it yourself. If T derives serde deserialise it will
then appropriatly handle bad requests without the need to handling it
explicitly.
